		   of the vector, but without any explicit data movements.) This
		   is also how BLIS interprets negative strides. The differences
		   is that with BLAS, the caller *always* passes in the 0th (i.e.,
		   top-most or left-most) element of the vector, even when the
		   stride is negative. By contrast, in BLIS, negative strides are
		   used *relative* to the vector address as it is given. Thus, in
		   BLIS, if this backwards traversal is desired, the caller *must*
		   pass in the address to the (n-1)th (i.e., the bottom-most or
		   right-most) element along with a negative stride. */ \

// are meant to be "public" with BLIS_EXPORT_BLIS (with BLIS_EXPORT_BLAS playing
// a similar role for BLAS compatibility routines). Which symbols are exported
// is controlled by the default symbol visibility, as specifed by the gcc option
// -fvisibility=[default|hidden]. The default for this option is 'default', or,
// "public", which, if allowed to stand, causes all symbols in BLIS to be
// linkable from the outside. But when compiling with -fvisibility=hidden, all
// symbols start out hidden (that is, restricted only for internal use by BLIS),
// with that setting overridden only for function prototypes or variable
// declarations that are annotated with BLIS_EXPORT_BLIS.

// program simply by providing a new definition. However, macOS uses a "two-level

// library and not overridable. As a workaround, certain symbols can be defined

// is optional. In C++, the "inline" keyword is required and obviates "static"
// altogether. Why does this matter? While BLIS is compiled in C99, blis.h may
